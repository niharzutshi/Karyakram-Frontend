<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Scheduling meetings and events takes more time than it should, there are about a hundred back and forths before all the parties decide on a date, time and venue and then add them to your calendars. It could have been solved with sharable calendars from Google, Microsoft and what not, but they only increased the number of calendars to keep track of. Karyakram gives you the solution to this and more!

What Karykram does:

- Gives you a public (or private if you want) profile a calender that syncs up all your isolated calendars and blocks your busy slots, showing people only the time you are available at and letting them book meetings and events with you :calendar:
- Register and login with your email, name identity or crypto wallet :key:
- Broadcast your events on the platform and put value to them by adding a cryptocurrency price for entry ticket :ticket:
- Features like reschedule, chat, block, broadcast, find trending events, monetize and much more for you to be a power user :zap:

And all of this open sourced! Yes, you can build your self hosted version of Karykram or use our free-to-use hosted platform
